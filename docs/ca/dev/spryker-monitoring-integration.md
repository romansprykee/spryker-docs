# Spryker Monitoring Integration
The Spryker Monitoring Integration is a comprehensive product capability designed to empower customers with advanced monitoring for their applications and systems. Leveraging [OpenTelemetry](https://opentelemetry.io/), this solution enables seamless connectivity and data forwarding of telemetry data, including traces and health status metrics, to OpenTelemetry-compatible monitoring platforms. This integration facilitates near real-time tracking of application performance and monitoring of system health status.

## What is OpenTelemetry (OTel)
OpenTelemetry is an open-source framework that provides APIs, libraries, and agents for collecting traces and metrics across various applications. It standardizes the instrumentation of software to help developers monitor and improve application performance effectively. OTel allows to provide a seamless and vendor-agnostic monitoring experience, empowering customers to integrate Spryker with their preferred APM solutions while adhering to industry best practices for collecting and analyzing performance data.

## How do I get it?
### Prerequisites
As a prerequisite, customers need to have an OpenTelemetry-compatible APM tool, which can be selected from the list of [supported vendors](https://opentelemetry.io/ecosystem/vendors/).

### How to Request Spryker Monitoring Integration
To request the Spryker Monitoring Integration, customers need to submit a Change Request through the Support Portal. Follow these steps:

- Submit a Change Request: Access the Support Portal and create a new Change Request.
- Provide the Following Information:
-- Endpoint: The endpoint URL of your APM tool.

### Instrumenting Your Application
